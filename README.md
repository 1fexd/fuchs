What's this?
------------

Scripts and patches to compile [Fennec F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.mozilla.fennec_fdroid/). They remove proprietary chunks from Mozilla code, rebrand Firefox to Fennec and build it. You can assemble your own APK in the very same way as F-Droid by cloning [recipes](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata) and running

    fdroid build org.mozilla.fennec_fdroid:VERCODE

where VERCODE is a version code number.
